```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
diabetes <- read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/odtsp7foaugu694/diabetes_data_clean.csv?dl=1")
```

I want to find out characteristics about patients who were readmitted before 30 days was up. 

```{r}
kable(
  diabetes %>% 
    group_by(readmitted) %>% 
    count(),
  align = c("l", "c"),
  caption = "Table 1: Readmission Categories"
)
```

```{r}
earlyadmit_tree <- rpart(readmitted ~ .,
                 data=diabetes)
rpart.plot(earlyadmit_tree)
```
Another tree to see if I can get better detail in the visuals
```{r}
rpart.plot(earlyadmit_tree, # middle graph
type=4,
extra=101, 
box.palette="GnBu",
branch.lty=3, 
shadow.col="gray", 
nn=TRUE
)
```
